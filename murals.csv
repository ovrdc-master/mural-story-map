Mahoning Commons Fence Line Mural Project,phil@youngstowncityscape.com,"The mural, titled ‘Project Yo’, was designed by Random Acts Of Artists (Sharon, PA) and installed at the Western Reserve Transit Authority headquarters on Mahoning Ave. Its theme is the evolution of a city – from a downtown skyline outline to a solid skyline and then an explosion of colors and patterns – and consists of over 25,500 multi-colored chain-link fence inserts which were installed by the community. The Mahoning Commons Association served as the host organization for the project and Youngstown CityScape served as project manager.
